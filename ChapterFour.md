# Recursion
A function calls it self. An object contains itself.

# Factorial 
n! = n * (n-1) ... 1
Represents the all possible way n distinct elements can be arranged in to a sequence. This a large number. almost n^n

# Binary Search
Remember: search on a sequence that is sorted! (nlogn for sorting time)
If unsorted, that time is n.
If sorted, that time using binary search is (logn)

# linea recursion
Always recurse on one side.(then it is logN) Binary recurse, always recurse on both side.

# Linea recursion to non-recursive approach
1. It must be a linear recursive, go only 1/2
2. It must return object, not object * something else
