#Chapter Three
##1.
The growth rate of an algorithm is important to exam.
Mathmatically, O(1) <O(log n) < O(n) < O(nlog(n)) < O(n^2) <<< O(2^n)

##2.
If a loop over n elements, then it is O(n), but if it has inner loop of n again, its is O(N^2).

##3.
Prefix_average. Given a list of S, S[0]...S[j], then calculate A[0]...A[j] so each A[i] is the average of S[0]...S[i]

##4.
Find uniqueness (or duplicate in the sequence), if not ordered, it will take N^2, if ordered, time is occupy by sorting, it is NlogN, then compare is N
